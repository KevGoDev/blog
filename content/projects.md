## Filesystem API Monitor
I developped a windows filesystem API monitor that is able to trace any access to any files on the system including [named pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes).
I originally built this application to find where an application was extracting its files. 
The application is written in C and uses [function hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking) in order to achieve its goal.

## Screen capture and upload service(W.I.P.)
I'm currently working on a screen capture application that let's you upload 
it to my server or as a self-hosted service.
